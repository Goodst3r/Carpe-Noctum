# Carpe Noctum (formerly NightSweep) project status

## Current: 2.0 Alpha build 3 · in development · Android code 27 (no APK yet) · November 11, 2026 UTC

Build 3 starts the build list in `docs/BUILD_LIST.md` (open pull request #2 on GitHub, branch `claude/build-list`). Development happens on branch `ccr-7abea525-rljsni`. The released installer is still **2.0 Alpha build 2** (`apk/CarpeNoctum-2.0-build2-preview.apk`, code 26). No build 3 APK exists: it must be built and signed with the original key outside this repository, from a frozen `outputs/Night_Sweep.html` whose hash is pinned after the full QA run. `android-build/build-readiness.json` says so explicitly.

### Build list progress

| Build list item | Status in build 3 |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Threshold and source registry | **Done for the new tools and job criteria.** Test → Limits, plus a source tag on every calculator formula. Older screens' example targets still to register |
| 2. Tilt/EQ/pad solver | Not started; next in the build order |
| 3. Station view and unity-gain worksheet | Not started; depends on item 2 |
| 4. Calculator bundle | **Done.** Test → Calculators: dB converter, ripple to distance, pre-EQ tap distance, OFDM power, echo delay |
| 5–20 | Not started. Source checks for items 5 and 7 are recorded in `research/build3/SOURCE_VERIFICATION.md` |

### What changed

- **Version:** labels, export filenames and PWA identity read 2.0 Alpha build 3; Android source identity is code 27. Package, provider/origin and storage keys are unchanged, so jobs and updates carry over.
- **Registry (`night-sweep/thresholds.js`):** 27 rows, each labeled spec, expert, company or unknown, with source, revision, page or section, units, conditions, plant and checked date. Tapping a tag opens a source sheet. Company values are read from where they already live (the job's project profile, the 42/54 meter-setup TX reference, or the built-in 31/43/38 local preset); blank is unknown and never zero. There is no new storage. Two existing app approximations are labeled Unknown: the 0.1 %/°F cable temperature correction (traced only to an indexed copy of CommScope MX0398) and the 0.004/°C resistance default (no recorded source). Example targets on older screens (Test → References workbook and sample targets, plant-picker starting levels) are not registered yet.
- **Calculators (`night-sweep/field-calcs.js`):** offline, deterministic, no job or storage writes. Invalid or missing input gives a reason, never a number. VP comes from catalog cables that list one (four today) or is typed in.
- **Practice:** the custom-curves exercise gains two guide steps (ten in total) and the feature index gains entries 38 and 39, so every task screen still has a seeded exercise.
- **QA:** `qa/build2-layout.test.py` now honors `NIGHTSWEEP_CHROMIUM`. New suites: `build3-registry.test.cjs`, `build3-field-calcs.test.cjs` (app output against independent 50-digit decimal references in `research/build3/field-calcs-reference.json`) and `build3-layout.test.py` (rendered Chromium, run separately like `browser-smoke.py`).

### Independent review

An adversarial review (four reviewers on math, provenance, UI and regressions, each checked by a skeptic) confirmed five defects in the first build 3 commit, all fixed: a registered 204/258 TX reference the app forbids; the 750 MHz example profile values described as entered by the user; the pre-EQ result not saying it is the spacing between two mismatches; the Limits list not refreshing after a job change; and the source sheet closing on a tap in its own padding. Lower-risk accuracy items were also applied: bounded calculator outputs, no "-0.00", calculators and registry left out of the printed report, the pre-EQ formula relabeled Expert (derived), and tighter citations. The build 2 and build 1 release records in `build-readiness.json` were restored.

### Current verification

All results below are from runs on November 11, 2026 in this cloud container, against standalone `outputs/Night_Sweep.html` SHA-256 `494cd587239250f0ee34e866290c7c7596c18d417c90e7b381894801d029762e`.

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automated suites | `NIGHTSWEEP_CHROMIUM=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium python3 qa/run-pwa.py` | **1,097 checks across 60 suites passed**; generated build unchanged during tests |
| New: registry | `node qa/build3-registry.test.cjs` (in the suite) | 13 checks |
| New: calculators | `node qa/build3-field-calcs.test.cjs` (in the suite) | 10 checks, 123 comparisons with the independent decimal references |
| New: rendered layout | `python3 qa/build3-layout.test.py` | **141 rendered Chromium checks passed** (320–1280 px, both palettes, print media) |
| Existing rendered smoke | `python3 qa/browser-smoke.py` | **328 rendered Chromium checks passed** |

The baseline before any change was 1,013 checks across 55 passing suites; two suites could not run here (no Python Playwright, no Android build receipt) and now run. Rendered checks are desktop Chromium with phone viewports, not Safari, WebView or a physical phone. No APK was built and no device was tested.

### Outstanding checks

- Build and sign the build 3 Preview APK with the original key; verify package, code 27, label, certificate, v2/v3 signatures, alignment and embedded HTML.
- Physical Android and iPhone checks remain undone for every 2.0 build, including the new screens.
- Most hardline catalog cables (P3, QR, MC2 .500–.750) do not list a VP yet; add datasheet VP with provenance before relying on catalog VP for them.
- Register the older screens' example targets (Test → References workbook 32/43 and sample 34/46 dBmV, anchor pairs, plant-picker starting levels) and add tags where they appear.
- Item 5 and 7 values are source-checked but not built. 47 CFR 76.611 (CLI) and 76.1706 were not checked yet.
- Pull request #1 (roadmap) and #2 (build list) are still open; this branch does not include their files.

# Previous baseline record (1.8 Alpha build 2)

**1.8 Alpha build 2 · Local release preparation · Android Preview code 24 · November 11, 2026 UTC**

Work is isolated in `/workspace/NightSweep_1.8_Alpha_build_2`; the previous 1.8 Alpha delivery remains frozen. Build 2 delivers one organized ZIP containing Android web, compatible Preview APK, iOS web, first-party source/tests, current guides, seven examples, public verification evidence and the requested text update log.

## Baseline and boundaries

The original handoff is 1.7 Alpha/build 22, Site commit `d4228cad024406b17feb5bde134f2c6f6a75d08e`. The preceding local 1.8 release's tests and browser receipts remain historical baseline evidence under `research/alpha18/` and `release/alpha18/`. Do not label those counts as current build 2 execution.

The known hosted site remains https://nightsweep-field.goodst3r.chatgpt.site. No public deployment, repository push, phone installation or RF acceptance is claimed. The existing Site repository remains canonical. The local package does not update that site by itself.

## Confirmed build 2 changes

- RF work is reused only inside one synchronous refresh; hidden Sweep charts defer expensive redraw until shown/printed. Full workflow refreshes are coalesced, preserving current calculations rather than caching across edits/imports.
- The compact route cascade scrolls in both directions and remains keyboard-accessible; the complete nine-point route remains reachable on phone-sized viewports.
- TDR barriers now follow parent-chain position when distinct zero-length active points share a coordinate. Another active cannot be bypassed forward or reverse; the chosen origin and valid exact-arrival/zero-travel cases remain supported.
- All JSON import routes apply the common 20 MiB UTF-8 text guard before parse or state replacement.
- Duplicating the active named job uses the latest working state and one atomic library write; failed writes cannot partially replace the saved original/copy. Unchanged job-list rendering preserves buttons/focus.
- Native export filenames obey UTF-8 byte limits; deferred print callbacks ignore stale callbacks after Activity/WebView teardown or replacement. Native source regressions and the real final build are recorded separately.
- DSIM setup review now rejects impossible imported calendar dates without normalizing the saved text into a complete result; valid leap/century dates and missing-as-incomplete behavior remain.
- Current labels/exports identify 1.8 Alpha build 2; Android version code 24 preserves Preview package/origin/provider identity. The original signer and official toolchain were used for the real final build. The owner's private signing backup is included only in top-level `PRIVATE_SIGNING/` in the master ZIP.
- Guides, all-functions/install references and training coverage are included as offline PWA pages. Main README now uses the actual Scientific Atlanta **SAT MM 4-23** model identity.

## Retained field/training requirements

Complete remains 21 steps: GS7K source, two GainMaker GaN HGD actives and Scientific Atlanta/GigaXtend/Technetix passives on 42/54. Forward design is 31 dBmV at 54 MHz / 43 dBmV at 860 MHz; return TX 38 remains a separate transmitter/plane reference. Node hardware 1218 MHz is distinct from entered path operating/planning 1000 and live 860 MHz.

The independent 13-step six-active Vecima/AOI run remains 204/258. Custom curves 8, OEM AGC 8, DSIM 9, manual/thermal 7 and conventional GS7K 10 retain separate guides. All 37 feature choices map to seeded exercises. Training/criteria stay synthetic/unapproved; existing saved jobs/copies are preserved.

## Current verification

The final frozen app passed **1,066 automated checks across 57 suites** and **322 rendered Chromium checks**, with unchanged generated bytes. The 54 grouped math checks include 72,001 numeric and 3,634 unavailable-result comparisons. Real Android compile, original signature, manifest, alignment and embedded-HTML checks passed; the Functions and installation PDFs contain 29 and 7 pages. Exact hashes, scopes and evidence paths are recorded in `release/build2/validation.json` and `research/build2/`.

The Android 15 software emulator accepted the compatible Build 22-to-24 update and retained a generic app-private fixture and UID. Both old and new builds then encountered the same stock WebView renderer SIGTRAP. Native screens, picker/save/share/print and actual job/original-evidence retention remain unverified; no physical Android or iPhone tests were performed. No cause in the app Java or JavaScript was established by this attempt.

The fresh math work retains established RF/power formulas and complete/trial answers; it adds topology regressions, RF/power properties, manufacturer-curve and seven-example replays. Local render benchmarks use synthetic plans and desktop Chromium/JSDOM; they are not physical-phone performance guarantees.

## Delivery and next checks

The release folder/ZIP is **NightSweep 1.8 Alpha build 2**. Read `README.md` for layout and `NightSweep_1.8_Alpha_build_2_UPDATE_LOG.txt` for the plain-text update record. Accepted APK: `Android/APK/NightSweep-1.8-build2-preview.apk`, with matching receipts. The owner explicitly requested the original key and password inside this private master ZIP; only `PRIVATE_SIGNING/` contains them. Source and both public web folders remain free of signing secrets. Downloaded toolchains/dependencies and historical binary archives are excluded.

Physical Android compatible-update retention, native save/share/print, Android/iOS touch/rotation and Safari/WebView offline cold starts/storage eviction remain device checks. Exact GaN/Quantum18 LE/BA/EN9000-RFAM-RPD/DSIM-A commissioning procedures remain documentation gaps. Native ONX proprietary decoding/OCR is not added. No full runtime branch/function coverage or plant certification is claimed.

Keep external full-project JSON backups before updates, rollback or transfers. APK/browser/Home Screen stores remain separate; no cloud sync or update-time wipe is added.
