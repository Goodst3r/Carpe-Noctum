## Next

Item 19 is merged. This branch is A5, item 14: a personal supply PM notebook and span voltage drop from the cable catalog. Its own full gate has not run. **D3: one run (Grok).** Spencer accepts or rejects D3.

The merged `handoff_docs/PROMPTS.md` tells Grok to do #20, then #25, then #26, then NAV-1. The chat that started this session says finish #20, then A5, A6 and A7, and ignore #25. This session follows the chat. #25 is not started.

## Blocked

Nothing yet. D3 is not met: one Grok run is not both lanes. Spencer accepts or rejects D3.

## Questions for Spencer

0. Which Vecima installation and commissioning guide title and revision does the company hold (item 17)? No steps will be invented.
1. Where should company settings live: each phone's browser (today, outside jobs and backups), or a shared company profile?
2. Who reviews the Safety, Outage and Leakage cards before coworkers use them?
3. A DOCSIS 3.1 modem that receives only SC-QAM channels: is its total input limit 33 or 40 dBmV?
